# <center> `Business Problem.`</center>

<p>Our client is an education company X Education that has appointed you to help them select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers.</p>

# <center> `Solution.`</center>

<p>Built a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.</p>
